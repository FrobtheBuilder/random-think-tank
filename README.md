The first thing you want to do is open up `ideasmash/settings.py` and change `MEDIA_ROOT = 'path/to/desired/media/location'` and the `"/path/to/the/templates/folder/"` (Hint: the media and template location is included in this repository.)

Then run `python manage.py runserver` and it should start serving on your localhost.
